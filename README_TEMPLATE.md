# n8n-nodes-solanaoperations

This is an n8n community node. It lets you interact with the Solana blockchain directly from your n8n workflows.

Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for fast and low-cost transactions. This node enables seamless interaction with Solana’s core features such as wallet creation, sending SOL or tokens, checking balances, staking, and cryptographic operations.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Operations

This node currently supports the following operations:

- ✅ **Send SOL** – Transfer native SOL tokens to another wallet
- ✅ **Send Token** – Transfer SPL tokens to another address
- ✅ **Get Balance** – Check SOL balance of an address
- ✅ **Get Token Balance** – Retrieve the SPL token balance
- ✅ **Get Multiple Token Balances** – Check multiple token balances in one go
- ✅ **Get Transaction Details** – Fetch information of a specific transaction
- ✅ **Get Account Info** – Inspect raw Solana account data
- ✅ **Create Wallet** – Generate a new keypair (public/private)

- ✅ **Withdraw Stake** – Withdraw staked SOL from a stake account

**Bonus**  
A special option is included for **donating 1% of the transaction amount to the dev team**. This is enabled by default on `Send SOL` operations, but users can disable it as needed.

## Credentials

This node uses a custom credential type named **Solana API**, requiring:

- **Private Key** – A base58-encoded private key (do not share!)
- **RPC URL** – The Solana cluster URL (e.g., https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com)

Make sure your wallet is funded and the RPC is reachable.
